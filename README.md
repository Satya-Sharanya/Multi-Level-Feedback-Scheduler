# Multi-Level-Feedback-Scheduler
This project implements a Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduler in C++ to handle process scheduling in a non-preemptive mode, utilizing FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve), SJF (Shortest Job First), and RR (Round Robin) algorithms.

**Key Features**
Dynamic Process Migration: Supports dynamic movement of processes across priority queues to optimize CPU utilization.
Detailed Performance Metrics: Outputs turnaround time, throughput, and other metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the scheduling algorithms.

**Tech Stack**
Programming Language: C++
Operating System: Linux
Concepts: CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems
